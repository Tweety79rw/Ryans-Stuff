# Ryans-Stuff
A Spring Boot aplication for a few web pages

##Back Ground  
I created a few javascript programs as an attempt to learn.  
One of them was a video poker game, [here is the original I made](https://github.com/Tweety79rw/javascript-video-poker-game).   
The other is a Conways game of life program, [here is the original I made](https://github.com/Tweety79rw/Conway-s-game-of-life).  
This repo is a revamping of those and maybe later add more.
As you can see the old code is unrefined and setup more like a c++ program with no account for the role of the html.

##Future
I plan on using this repo for new web projects that I write. That might include a black jack game.

##Interesting Feature
I tried making the [card deck javascript](https://github.com/Tweety79rw/Ryans-Stuff/blob/master/HttpPage/src/main/resources/static/js/cardDeckClass.js) something that could be used for any card game. Something that could be added is the ability to use multiple decks. But it's still fairly unpolished.
